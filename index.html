    <h1>Learn HTML</h1>

    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Hypertext</strong> means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places
        in the document or to another document altogether. A <strong>Markup Language</strong> is a way that computers
        speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and
        attributes.</p>

    <h2>Tags and Attributes</h2>
    <p>Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.</p>
    <h3>Tags</h3>
    <p>Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An
        example
        of a tag is: < h1>. Most tags must be opened < h1> and closed < /h1> in order to function.</p>
    <h3>Attributes</h3>
    <p>Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and this
        is where
        additional info is placed inside.

        An example of an attribute is:

        < img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog.">

            In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the < img> tag.

    </p>
    <h2>Basic Construction of an HTML Page</h2>
    <p>These tags should be placed underneath each other at the top of every HTML page that you create.
        <br>
    <p>
        < !DOCTYPE html> — This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, the language is
            HTML
            5.
    </p>
    <p>
        < html> — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.
    </p>
    < head> — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other
        computer programs.
        <p>
        <p>
            < title> - This is where the title of the page is defined in the browser toolbar
        </p>
        < body> — This is where the content of the page goes.
            </p>

            </p>
